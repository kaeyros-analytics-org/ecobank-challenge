<h3><strong>An Innovative Solution to Improve Customer Satisfaction in the Banking Sector</strong></h3>
<h4>Why Banks Need to Improve Customer Satisfaction?</h4>
<p>
    In the modern banking world, customer satisfaction has become a crucial element for success and customer loyalty.
    Historically, banks have often been perceived as rigid and bureaucratic institutions, where the individual needs of
    customers were often neglected in favor of standardized processes. However, with the advent of digital technology
    and increased competition in the financial sector, this perception has begun to change.
</p>
<p>
    Today, customers expect fast, personalized, and efficient services. Banks now have to compete not only with other
    traditional banking institutions but also with innovative and agile fintechs that have redefined the standards of
    customer service. In this context, providing an exceptional customer experience is no longer an option but a
    necessity to survive and thrive.
</p>
<p>
    Modern banks want solutions dedicated to customer experience and tailored to their specific needs, transparent
    interactions, and quick resolutions to their problems. It is in this context that our Claims Analytics application
    positions itself as a revolutionary solution to help banks improve their customer service.
</p>
<br>
<h4><strong>Our Solution: Claims Analytics</strong></h4>
<p>Our Claims Analytics application is designed to transform how banks interact with their customers and manage their data.
    By integrating advanced data analysis, machine learning, and visualization technologies, we offer a comprehensive and
    intuitive platform that allows banks to better understand and respond to their customers' needs. Here is a detailed
    overview of the key features of our application:
</p>
<br>
<strong>Home Page</strong>
<p>
The home page of our application offers a concise and engaging introduction to the application. It explains the main
objectives of the project, its key features, and the importance of data analysis in improving banking services. This
page serves as the starting point for users, providing a clear overview of the available tools and analyses.
</p>
<br>
<strong>Map Page: Geographical Distribution of Claims</strong>
<p>This page is dedicated to the geographical visualization of customers who have filed complaints. With an interactive
    map, managers can visualize the distribution of claims by region. This feature helps identify geographical areas where
    claims are most frequent, thus helping the bank target its resolution efforts and improve customer satisfaction in these
    specific regions. For instance, if a particular region shows a high volume of service-related complaints, the bank can
    allocate additional resources to resolve these issues and enhance satisfaction in that region.
</p>
<br>
<strong>Recommendations Page: Product Personalization and Claims Categorization</strong>
<p>The recommendations page uses a machine learning algorithm to suggest personalized products for each customer. The user
    can select a customer, and the algorithm, trained with customer conversation data, suggests the products best suited to
    their needs and preferences. This feature helps personalize the bank's offerings, thereby increasing conversion rates
    and customer satisfaction. Additionally, it enables the categorization of customer complaints into specific topics and
    indicates the services capable of handling each type of complaint. For example, a customer who has shown interest in
    low-risk investment products will be offered specific options that match their profile.
</p>
<br>
<strong>Claims Analytics Page: Quantitative and Emotional Analysis</strong>
<p>Finally, the Claims Analytics page presents an in-depth analysis of customer complaints. This section is divided into
    two parts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Quantitative Analysis: This section presents information such as the total number of complaints, active customers, and
        more. These data allow the bank to understand the main problems encountered by customers and identify areas for
        improvement.
    </li>
    <li>Emotional Analysis: Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this section analyzes the emotions expressed
        in customer complaints. It provides insights into the overall sentiment of customers, enabling the bank to better
        understand their experiences and respond more empathetically and effectively. For example, if customers frequently
        express feelings of frustration or anger, the bank can take proactive measures to improve its services and address
        customer concerns.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
