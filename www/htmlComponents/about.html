<h3><strong>An Innovative Solution to Improve Customer Satisfaction in the Insurance Sector</strong></h3>
<h4>Why Insurers Need to Improve Customer Satisfaction?</h4>
<p>
    In today's insurance world, customer satisfaction has become a crucial element for success and policyholder loyalty.
    Historically, insurance companies have often been perceived as rigid and bureaucratic institutions, where the individual needs of clients were often neglected in favor of standardized processes. However, with the advent of digital technology and increased competition in the industry, this perception has begun to change.
</p>
<p>
    Today, policyholders expect fast, personalized, and efficient services. Insurance companies now have to compete not only with other traditional insurers but also with innovative and agile insurtechs that have redefined the standards of customer service. In this context, providing an exceptional customer experience is no longer an option but a necessity to survive and thrive.
</p>
<p>
    Modern insurers are looking for solutions dedicated to customer experience and tailored to their specific needs, offering transparent interactions and quick resolutions to their problems. It is in this context that our Claims Analytics application positions itself as a revolutionary solution to help ACTIVA Assurance improve its customer service.
</p>
<br>
<h4><strong>Our Solution: Claims Analytics</strong></h4>
<p>Our Claims Analytics application is designed to transform how ACTIVA Assurance interacts with its clients and manages their data.
    By integrating advanced data analysis, machine learning, and visualization technologies, we offer a comprehensive and intuitive platform that allows ACTIVA Assurance to better understand and respond to its policyholders' needs. Here is a detailed overview of the key features of our application:
</p>
<br>
<strong>Home Page</strong>
<p>
The home page of our application offers a concise and engaging introduction to the application. It explains the main
objectives of the project, its key features, and the importance of data analysis in improving insurance services. This
page serves as the starting point for users, providing a clear overview of the available tools and analyses.
</p>
<br>
<strong>Map Page: Geographical Distribution of Claims</strong>
<p>This page is dedicated to the geographical visualization of policyholders who have filed claims. With an interactive map, managers can visualize the distribution of claims by region. This feature helps identify geographical areas where claims are most frequent, thus helping ACTIVA Assurance target its resolution efforts and improve customer satisfaction in these specific regions. For instance, if a particular region shows a high volume of service-related claims, the company can allocate additional resources to resolve these issues and enhance satisfaction in that region.
</p>
<br>
<strong>Recommendations Page: Product Personalization and Claims Categorization</strong>
<p>The recommendations page uses a machine learning algorithm to suggest personalized products for each policyholder. The user can select a client, and the algorithm, trained with customer conversation data, suggests the products best suited to their needs and preferences. This feature helps personalize the insurer's offerings, thereby increasing conversion rates and customer satisfaction. Additionally, it enables the categorization of customer claims into specific topics and indicates the services capable of handling each type of claim. For example, a policyholder who has shown interest in low-risk investment products will be offered specific options that match their profile.
</p>
<br>
<strong>Claims Analytics Page: Quantitative and Emotional Analysis</strong>
<p>Finally, the Claims Analytics page presents an in-depth analysis of customer claims. This section is divided into two parts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Quantitative Analysis: This section presents information such as the total number of claims, active clients, and more. These data allow ACTIVA Assurance to understand the main issues faced by policyholders and identify areas for improvement.
    </li>
    <li>Emotional Analysis: Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this section analyzes the emotions expressed in customer claims. It provides insights into the overall sentiment of clients, enabling ACTIVA Assurance to better understand their experiences and respond more empathetically and effectively. For example, if clients frequently express feelings of frustration or anger, the company can take proactive measures to improve its services and address customer concerns.
    </li>
</ul>
