is that every month the bank deducts me some money like 2000f,3000f etc. the worst one just happened that my salary for two weeks came in to be 369000f ,but when i got to the bank i instead saw -133000f. my son is lying in the hospital since yesterday ( monday) morning till now tired in sickness. i don't know what to do now. but i will remain still doing my job for more money to be paid in while i see how to pay the bills with money which i borrowed. meanwhile i once asked madam natasha ,(my gestionaire whom i will ask to be changed,)to give me her number so that i can call her in time of misunderstanding,but she gave me a fake number that has never gone through till today. she equally gave me the number of the vice manager. i called him n he said i should pass by the office each time i have a problem. i don't have time. that is my problem. thanks for understanding."},{"key":"client","value":"fichier jpg"},{"key":"client","value":"now i wish the following; 1) to have my

unnecessary deductions be replaced into my account. 4) i am repaying a loan of 18,000,000f with interest meanwhile 500,000f was deducted and kept in the bank. i need that 500,000f so that when i pay interest, it should be that i actually took and used the money. 5) i thank you for understanding."},{"key":"client","value":"good morning sir. i am a customer at Ecobank fb , mimboman branch. my name
